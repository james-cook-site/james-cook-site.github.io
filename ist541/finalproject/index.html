	<p> <strong>During the past year or so, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, many golf courses have had to operate with reduced budgets and fewer staff members. Essential tasks such as mowing have become the main focus while other tasks have been delayed or, in some cases, even eliminated. Golf courses will be playing catchup for a while. Doing our part to keep our golf courses in good shape will allow the maintenance crews to focus on more critical tasks. Just a little extra effort by each of us can make a huge impact. There are many ways to make an impact, and this website is designed to help the golfer understand the proper techniques and different ways that we can all help keep our courses beautiful for generations to come. </strong> </p>
